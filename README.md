# 👋 Hello there

**I'm Xeon** — builder, systems thinker, and curious mind.

Welcome to my GitHub. This is where ideas turn into structure, and personal projects grow into full-blown systems.

## 🧠 About Me

I like things that *work* — cleanly, logically, and with intent.  
Whether it’s organizing the mess behind digital storage or getting classic hardware to do something unexpected, I enjoy solving problems in ways that feel intuitive and useful.

Also currently learning Spanish. Slowly, but deliberately.

- 🔥 [**The Burner Method**](https://github.com/JSSchumacher/The-Burner-Method)
